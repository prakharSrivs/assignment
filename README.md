Step 3: Launch the Project
- Start the frontend server: In the `frontend` directory, execute: `npm start`
- Start the backend server: In the `backend` directory, execute: `npm start`
  
**Note:** At this point, you might not see any content on the project interface because the dataset hasn't been provided yet.

- Inside the database, find the collection named "data-sets."
- Import the dataset using the provided JSON file, `jsondata.json`.

Congratulations! You're all set, and both data and charts should now be visible on your screen.
